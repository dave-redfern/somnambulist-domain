Provides a core set of support classes for building domain oriented projects. This library compiles the
previously separate domain and mapping libraries into a single project for easier maintenance.

It consists of:
 
 * Commands
   * CommandBus interface / abstract command
   * SF Messenger implementation
 * Doctrine
   * Enumeration factories + Type bindings
   * Additional types / type overrides for the Doctrine Type system
   * Abstract EntityLocator that extends EntityRepository
   * Custom Postgres DQL functions
   * Custom traits for EntityRepository
 * Models
   * Contracts - value object interface definitions
   * Types - a collection of value-objects, enumerations, and date helpers
   * AggregateRoot - an aggregate root stub implementation that can raise events
   * AbstractEntity and AbstractEntityCollection - child entities and helper for an aggregate root
 * Events
   * EventBus interface / abstract event
   * SF Messenger EventBus implementation
   * Doctrine subscriber that broadcasts onFlush all events from aggregate roots
   * Custom serializer to handle encode/decode when the event class does not exist
 * Jobs
   * JobQueue interface / abstract job
   * SF Messenger implementation 
 * Queries
   * QueryBus interface / abstract query
   * SF Messenger implementation 
 * default XML mappings for embeddable objects in Doctrine .dcm.xml and Symfony .orm.xml conventions

### Requirements

 * PHP 8.0+
 * mb_string
 * bcmath
 * beberlei/assert
 * eloquent/enumeration
 * somnambulist/collection
 * symfony/messenger for the Messenger bus implementations.

### Installation

Install using composer, or checkout / pull the files from github.com.

 * composer require somnambulist/domain

### Upgrading from 4.X to 5.X

From 5.X this project will be re-namespaced to drop `Domain`. 4.X includes a `classmap.php` providing
aliases for backwards compatibility.

### Upgrading from 3.X to 4.X

From 4.X this project was re-namespaced to `Somnambulist\Components\Domain`. Update all references to
reflect this change this includes any Doctrine mapping files / annotations.

The Doctrine `AbstractIdentityType` was moved out of the `Identity` namespace to the main `Types`.
